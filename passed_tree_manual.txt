CHI KHASSEK T3REF !!!

--you can start from the (execution.c) file that i created in exec directory

--uncomment print_tree function if you wanna visualize the tree

--in case there is no OPERATION (||, &&, |) the root left will contain the first word and all the other flags option will be on right

MORE DETAILS:

      FOR EXAMPLE: echo "abdo is a nice guy (i'm lying)" test

      the root node left will contain (echo) and each other word will be on right

      left->word == echo, right->word == "abdo is a nice guy (i'm lying)", right->word == test.

      other than that the root will contain (&&, ||, |) you know depends on the input;

      mn lekher:
          
          in case you wanted to execute a command if you found it on a node keep checking,
                  the right if theres other flags options to execute
        (if node->right->word->token != PIPE, AND, OR, keep diging and execution right (flags))
